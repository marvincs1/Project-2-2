<p>On March 13, 2020, "X" Hospital reported a suspected confirmed case of the novel Coronavirus (Covid-19). 
 The patient was immediately isolated and discharged after evaluation. March 13 is the day that everything turned upside down within our facility. 
 Rumors begin to spread that we had the first Covid-19 case, some believed it and others didn't. Yet, we could have never suspected what was ahead for each of us. 
 Within three days our entire work life changed, in-person meetings were completely suspended until further notice, cafeterias dining areas were completely shut down, masks started to be mandatory, a goggles policy took place for all clinical and non-clinical staff. 
 A hospital that was once very cheerful and hopeful became depressing with empty hallways and empty lounge areas. 
 On March 18, elective surgeries and procedures had officially been postponed which meant that we would see fewer visitors or public within the premises. Also, employees 65 and older were advised to remain home which cause a big gap in hospital staff.
 At that moment that was our new normal and like every situation, we had to learn to adjust and keep pushing forward.
