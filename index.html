<h1>  History of Club America </h1>
 <p> Club de Fútbol América S.A. de C.V., commonly known as Club América or simply América, is a professional football club based in Mexico City, Mexico. 
  Nicknamed Las Águilas (The Eagles), it competes in Liga MX, the top tier of Mexican football.
  The club was founded in 1916, and since 1959 has been owned by media company Televisa.
  The team plays its home games at the Estadio Azteca, the largest stadium in Latin America, and one of the largest stadiums in the world.
  América is one of the founding members of the Primera División. 
  The club has a long-standing rivalry with Guadalajara, as both are the most successful and most popular clubs in the country, and are the only clubs to have never been relegated.
  Matches between them are known as El Súper Clásico, considered to be the biggest rivalry in Mexico, and one of the biggest in the world.
  América also play local derbies against Cruz Azul and Club Universidad Nacional.
  Club América have won more titles than any other team in Mexican football, with a record thirteen league titles, as well as a record six Copa México titles, and six Campeón de Campeones cups. 
  In international competitions, América has won ten FIFA recognized club trophies, the most for a club from the CONCACAF region, with a record seven CONCACAF Champions Cup/Champions League titles, two Copa Interamericana cups and one CONCACAF Giants Cup.
  The club also holds numerous distinctions, including topping the all-time league table in victories and points, the most appearances in the playoff stage, most finals appearances, and most runner-up finishes along with Cruz Azul.
  América was named by the IFFHS as the best North American club of the first decade (2001–2011) of the 21st century.
